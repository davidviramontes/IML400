  		<h2> The World Wide Web </h2>
  		<p>It is interesting reading these documents about the earliest incarnations of the internet because they seem so basic in their understanding of how it functions, but they are still relevant in that the internet still functions much in the same way they describe. Hypertext is described in the same way it is implemented today and the process of an internet search is still a staple of internet browsing.</p>
  		<p>I found this reading to be quite accurate in terms of predicting the future of the internet. These authors weren’t just throwing things on the wall to see what sticks, they were very precisely creating an environment that would provide people with a platform to communicate ideas. So many of their desires are focused on making the web easier to use.</p>
  		<p>Towards the end, they list possible developments and reading it now, it seems as though may of them are completed. They talk about making the web more user-friendly in a creative sense and I think we are definitely there with so many website building platforms that interestingly use the web to operate for-profit businesses which was another one of their predictions.</p>
		<p>I was a bit confused reading about W3 as if it weren’t the unquestionably dominant tool used to surf the web and it’s fascinating to think of a time when there were competing platforms. However, when comparing W3 to Gopher and WAIS, it’s clear that W3 was the superior option to both because of it’s ability to surface all types of content.</p>
